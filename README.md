Rust FFI wrappers for the Linux Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).

## Supported Rust versions
The library is only continuously built against Rust stable, beta and nightly but as it does not use a lot of new language features it should probably compile on older versions as well.
If you encounter problems building on older versions and a small fix can be applied to make the build succeed, consider opening a pull request.
